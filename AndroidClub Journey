Hi, I'm Pratyush, a student of VIT Chennai. 
I was in the Android Club for Year 2021-2022. It was a great experience. Our seniors used to guide and teach us about Android Development, espescially React Native.
I was int the 2nd Year when I joined that club. I was an FFCS member @ Andoid Club VITC. It was an amazing journey for me from a noob who didn't knnow anything of Android Development to an Intermediate guy. I liked the way our seniors used to teah us. They were always available to resolve our doubts whether it's a day orn night. I also organized and participated in few events. Revelation,2021 is one among these. 
Now I'm coming to the crux, what I learned fro Android Club. 
I learnt what's the structure of any Android App. I learnt that there are two ways to create Android Apps using React Native, i.e, using expo & using Android Studio.
I learnt what's StatusBar, useState, useEffect, StyleSheet, Text, View, ActivityIndicator, TextInput, Dimensions, ImageBackground, StatusBar, wetaher API, EvilIcons, etc.
I learnt what is state and how to use it. I also learnt how to create multiple pages.
And many more.
I'll learn new things in future as well.
Thank You Android Club for giving me an insight of Android App Deveolpment.
